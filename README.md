Move the unordered list to a sidebar that’s floated to the left of the remaining content,
which should be coded in a section. The width of the sidebar should be 160 pixels. Be
sure to clear the footer so it’s not displayed below the list. Adjust the margins and padding for the sidebar and section as necessary. (Note: Because
the unordered list is given some left padding by default, you don’t need to apply any
additional margin or padding to it.) Modify the HTML for the first heading in the section so it’s displayed on two lines.
Modify the second heading as shown. Then, add the image (cat1.jpg) and the link below
the heading. The link should display a page named cat.html in the products folder.
